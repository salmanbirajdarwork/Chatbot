 10,000,000 seriously....
 If you won 10,000,000, what would you do?
 Well, first thing I'd do, I'd probably buy a nice house for me and my wife.
 OK, where would this house be?
 Oh, I don't know. We'll have to talk about that with the wife but probably somewhere near Tokyo.
 OK. Would yo buy a house in the city or the country?
 Well, a little further out of the middle of Tokyo.
 So, it'd be in Japan.?
Yeah, in Japan, but some place not too crowded.
 OK, would you have animals at this house?
 Not if I could help it.
 Really. No dog?
 Well, maybe a dog, but an outside dog.
 You got to have a dog, man.
