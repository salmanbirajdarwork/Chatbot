
OK, Jessica, we are going to talk about cooking
OK 
Now, you like to cook! 
Yes 
OK What can you cook?
I can cook Manicotti, Tacos, lots of food
OK So what is Manicotti? 
Manicotti isit's a big noodle It's hollow on the inside and you fill it with different cheeses and then you put red tomato sauce over the top of it andit's pretty good
So how do you make it?
Well, you use Ricotta cheese, Mozzarella cheese, um , Parmesan Cheese,a little bit of salt, and basil and stuff and you mix it all together in a pot and then you stuff it in the noodle, and you put the noodle in the pan and shove it in the oven for 35 minutes and let it cook 
Yeah!
And it's good 
That sounds really good How often do you make manicotti?
Oh, a couple times a month, probably 
What is the secret to good manicotti?
You got to make it tasty, cause if you add enough salt or Parmesan cheese then it doesn't taste as goodIt just tastes like your eating cheese That's it 
OK Well I'll remember that Thanks a lot Jessica
You're welcome
