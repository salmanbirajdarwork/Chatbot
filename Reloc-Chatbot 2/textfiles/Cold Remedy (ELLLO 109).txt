
hey, how are you feeling today?
I'm realy tired
Yeah, yeah
Kind of, I don't know, my throat's really scratchy, so maybe I'm coming down with something
Oh, no That's terrible Are you taking anything for it?
Actually, I am I had a private student last night and she told me some wild formula to do And she asked me to take coca-cola, boil it, add some ginger, and then drink it, however, I'm caffiene sensitive so it kept me up pretty much all night, so I'm really tired today 
How did it taste?
It wasn't bad If it was probably mid-afternoon, I would love it, but 11:30 at night it kept me up
Oh, no
Yeah
Are you going to try it again, but maybe in the morning?
No I think I'm just going to stick with the regular cold syrup, and just take that
Yeah, that stuff tastes terrible
It does
