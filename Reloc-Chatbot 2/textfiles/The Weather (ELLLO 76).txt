
Hey, Marika!
Hey!
How you doing?
I'm OK. How are you?
Good. Marika do you like summer?
No, I don't like summer it's my least favorite summer.
Wow, why?
Because I don't like hot weather. I don't like being hot and sweaty and uncomfortable.
OK. Well, it's pretty hot in Japan so you must not like summer here.
No, I don't. 
Is it hot in summer where you're from?
Yeah, it's pretty hot but usually we go away on the weekends to cottages and we go swimming in lakes and stuff.
Oh, that's nice. Where are you from by the way?
Canada.
So, what's your favorite season?
Winter or fall.
OK. Well, what do you do in the winter?
In the winter, activities you mean?
Yeah.
I go snow boarding and I go to onsens and I walk around and I enjoy the cold weather.
