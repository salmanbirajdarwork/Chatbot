
I can't cook well, but I do cook, so I think the reason why I can't cook well is because I can eat anything, so I don't try very hard to make it take good.
What do you like to cook?
I like to barbecue outside on the grill.
What do you put on your barbecue?
When I cook meat, I don't put much, only salt, pepper, and a little bit of seasoning.
OK. Good. Next, do you think you're a good dancer?
No, I don't think I'm a good dancer and I don't really try to be a good dancer.
Do you not like to dance?
No, I don't like to dance.
At all?
Right.
I heard that you're a good line dancer.
I would like to learn how to line dance, and I do like country music but I haven't been officially taught how to line dance.
So you don't dance at all?
No.
Next, are you a good singer?
No, I'm not a good singer but I do enjoy going to Karaoke.
What do you like to sing?
In Hawaii, when I go to Karaoke I enjoy singing Hawaiian music. If I'm in Japan I like to sing other English songs that they have, usually country music or 80's or 90's music.
Good. That's good. Do you think you're a good student?
I don't know if I'm a good student. Growing up I was not a good student but now I am trying harder to be a good student.
How were you not a good student growing up?
I didn't enjoy going to school and I didn't try very hard in school. Now I try a little harder. I make an effort. 
Can you talk more about your effort? What do you do to try to be a good student?
I try to listen to the teachers now instead of doing my own thing, and I try to complete everything with good quality.
That's good. And, last do you think that you're a good athlete?
Growing up I was a good athlete. I played a few sports. Now I don't play any sports anymore because I'm old, but growing up I think I was a good athlete.
What sports did you play?
I played American football, baseball, and soccer.
Which one is your best sport?
I would say football. American football is my best sport.
How long did you play?
I played since I was eleven until age twenty-two.
So for eleven years. And you played when you were in university?
I played at the University of Hawaii.
