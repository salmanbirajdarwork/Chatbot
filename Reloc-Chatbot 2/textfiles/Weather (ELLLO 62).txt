
Hey, James!
Yeah!
Let's talk about seasons.
OK.
James, what is your favorite season?
My favorite season is spring.
Yeah, why is that?
Because it's not so cold but it's not so hot that I'm sweating on the train. I can go to the beach. I can relax with my friends outside. It's very nice.
OK. What is your least favorite season?
My least favorite season in Japan is the rainy season ...because I don't like rain at all.
OK. What season are we in right now?
Right now it is the very end of winter. It is just starting to become spring.
What's the weather like today?
Today, it's very sunny. It's a little cool. A little breezy. It's very nice. I enjoy it.
