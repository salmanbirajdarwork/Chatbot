
Hey, Keri. Let's talk about summer. 
OK. 
Do you like summer?
Yes, I do.
OK. Why?
Because it's warm, and blue skies, and fluffy white clouds.
That's true. Now, you grew up in Southern California. What was it like growing up on the beach in the summer?
It was great. It was a lot of fun. It's nice.
Did you learn how to surf?
I tried a couple of times but I didn't want to learn in the summer time cause the beaches are too crowded so I tried in the winter but the water is very cold so I gave up after a couple of tries.
Oh, really. Even in winter it's too cold, the water.
Yeah, the Pacific's cold.
