The battery with lower capacity (1300mAh) will drag down the capacity of the higher ones (2300mAh). So the whole set can only deliver 1300mAh. Furthermore, as the weakest cell is depleted first, it will get reverse-charged by other cells. This can cause permanent damage in the weakest cell and make its capacity drop even further."},

The LED is composed of a solid chunk of heavy-duty plastic with a thick semiconductor inside, instead of a fragile glass case with an extremely thin wire suspended inside. 100000 hours is probably speculation, some defective LEDs may go out sooner, while others may last indefinitely, but that should be an average.

(Several years ago). They reported that chain-store house-brand batteries (Walgreens or Radio Shack, for example) lasted 80% to 90% as long as the more expensive coppertop and energizer brand batteries for less money. So that is what I use for all the remotes in our house. All AA and AAA batteries are the same size and will fit any device that calls for them. With that being said, Lithium batteries are a totally different composition. They are more expensive, but they are definitely worth the money for long battery life in certain high-tech devices, just as their advertising claims. My personal experience with digital cameras confirms that."},

You could take the bracelet to a local engraver who could add this information for you. There is some room on the pendant for additional engraving. I am a volunteer Fire Fighter and Emergency Medical Responder. \"Diabetes\" gives me valuable information in the event of an emergency. If I saw \"Diabetic & Insulin\" on your bracelet, it would not change my procedures. I suggest you contact your local fire department, police or ambulance service to see what they suggest. As these will be the people who respond in the event of an emergency, I imagine that their opinion would be primary to your concern. I hope that helps. Best regards, Don"},

How many months has your wife been using the monitor? My understanding is that for the first cycle or two, the monitor may be 'getting to know' the hormone fluctuations of the particular woman using it and may therefore not show a peak in the beginning. If your wife just started using it, I would say to maybe try again for another month or two. If this happens repeatedly month after month, it may be an indication that she's not ovulating, and visiting a doctor for some fertility blood work might be helpful. I have also heard of women getting pregnant on cycles where the monitor doesn't show a peak. Best of luck."},

Our commode is oval and somewhat elongated, and the sitz bath fits just fine. The holding power(?) of the device is the side parts of the bath. Actually, you wouldn't want the commode to be TOO short because the overflow holes in the front and th back need some space around them to shoot excess water back into the toilet, not onto the floor.

The user's legs do press on the front part of the basin, but most of the other weight should be distributed and supported by the toilet. If I were you, I would consult with the manufacturer on the weight limit. Other than that, since the bath costs only $10.19, if you can afford that big an investment risk, I'd say, \"Go for it!\""},

Doing so could cause problems. Some have been successful at it initially, but over time, problems develop and they find they can't use that method any more. Where they pop off the head into the magnetic part of the brush head, weakens, and the brush pops off while it's being used in the mouth. I personally wouldn't want that to happen to me. When people use products as they were not intended to be used, maybe it will be fine, but I don't want to take that kind of risk. Environmentally, you can recycle the brush head complete with the magnet attachment. Philips does make brushes that work as you describe. Just the head, goes into the base. Those toothbrushes do not last as long. I have had my Eseries for seven years and it is still going strong. The vibration is stronger than the other model I tried. It does a better job. It's worth paying more for Sonic brand brush heads that are meant to be on the toothbrush you use. Your entire unit lasts longer. It's stronger.

My last One Touch meter came without a lancing device. In general, lancets are pretty generic. I personally like the one-touch branded lancets (LifeScan) because the needle protector is like a cup or cap that fits right over the lancing needle, instead of a disk like some of the lancets. (If you order test strips some sellers will give you lancing needles, but they always seem to be the ones with the disks on the needle.) I remove the old lancet and put the new lancet in the device and remove the cap and put it on the old lancet and dispose of it in my sharps container. (I only change twice a week or if I let someone else use my lancing device.) I don't cap the lancet while it's in the device. I don't feel changing it every poke is worth the time and only a couple of times a year does my finger hurt and it's more likely where on the finger I poke it or if I didn't clean my finger enough first, rather than infections on the needle (except if I poke a not-well-cleaned finger and the next one transmits from the dirty finger to an otherwise clean finger and infects it."},

It's portable, so you could theoretically use it for a passenger in the car, but I think the typical car seat is too springy for the lift to be of much use. The lift is basically a spring, so the downward force is equal to the upward force. You might be able to adjust the weight to allow for that though. Definitely do not use it for the driver's seat though. If you hit a bump or dip in the road, it would most likely lift you away from the gas and brake pedals while the car is in motion. It really works best in a \"hard\" chair or padded dining-room style chair."},

I say about as there is a slight curvature to the seat. We use it in a recliner which is very roomy, so we have to do some adapting. You will sit higher on the lift which makes the arms, if you depend on them, low, so we use some pillows. We also push the base of he lift into the crack at the back of the seat.

I took a chance....it seems to be working. Dunno how it would handle others, or how it would be for various groups, but hey...for less than 50 bucks from Amazon, it might be worth a chance.

Replacing the cutter (blades) is as easy as pulling the old ones off and pressing the new ones off (they snap into place in a fairly obvious way once you remove the foil screen assembly the way you normally would to clean the blades). Replacing the screen (which is probably the part you need to replace because they are a bit delicate) is more touchy. The screens fit into the entire top (I will call it the screen assembly- the part you remove to clean the razor). I recall that I had to fiddle with it a while to figure it out but I eventually got it without need of any instructions. The replacement screens are great and extend the life of what I find to be a very good razor with one weak part (the foil screens crack and break kind of easily). I hope that helps."},

The upper stays secure (even through eating and drinking) for the 12 hours the company claims. Stability in the lower I think depends on what percentage of bone you have left. I don't have a lot and the denture starts detaching after roughly 4-5 hours after applying Secure. I don't fault the product for that. :) That being said, I've decided this is really the best adhesive on the market for lower dentures. Even if I have to reapply the adhesive for the lower a couple of times a day, I have found I can eat pretty much anything I want if I reapply an hour before eating dinner. I think people with more bone in the lower ridge will have better success. One other thing - a little of this product goes a long way...there's a definite art to applying just the right amount of adhesive for maximum hold...too little and the adhesive gives out, too much and the adhesive gives out AND you end up with a mouth full of goop. I would suggest you do what I did - order a tube and experiment. Unless I'm alerted to a new and better product down the road, this is what I'll be using going forward."},

Was good for a week or less, the odor got back again the same way. 4- Wash them in washing machine, inside out, same as dishwasher, it was good for a week, then stinky again (and I did not load the machine with towels like the other responder, maybe that is the trick?) I have talked to other folks and no one really knows how to get rid of the bad odor. The gloves are awesome and last for a long time, though I change them due to stinkiness issue.

For all ovens, or heavy top surface cleaning, other than aluminum surfaces which will be stained by this product, use a janitorial supply non-aerosol oven and grille cleaner, with gloves. It is much cheaper and less fuming than the aerosol from the supermarket. It costs about $12/gallon, which can be diluted 1:1 with water and sprayed on. This industrial type cleaner will last you 20 times longer than 1 $3-$4 can of spray.Oven racks can be cleaned w/ pumice stone also. If you have scratched/stained areas around burners on gas stoves without separate drip pans, or above pilots between burners, use a paste of Comet with oven and griddle cleaner, leave it on overnight and remove with water the next day (wear gloves!).

I had lateral meniscus surgery back in 1977 (the old way before arthroscopic was available). After 35 years, there is simply nothing left to cushion my knee joint. The brace helps prevent some of the looseness and grinding that takes place when I run or ride my bike. It is really tight, provides good side to side and twisting resistance, and does a lot to ease my pain.

I can actually pick up things with a little bit of weight to them (like my dog's bed, pad, and blanket eor a heavy can) without it bending or breaking and I can pick up teeny tiny onjects (like dropped pills) without any problem. It's longer than all the other ones so you might have to put whatever you're picking up on a table to reach it (I have long arms so it's not a problem for me). I LOVE this one. My OT recommended it.

However, the powder mix is already a SuperFood which compensates for the nutrients you are losing on a daily basis. For example, the food pyramid tells us to eat certain amounts of fruits, vegetables, grains , etc thru-out the day, but with Greens Plus it gives you that well balance in just one glass! You mix it with water. You can be creative and add a banana or another of your favorite fruit. For myself, I choose not to add SuperFood, something that is already potent with nutrional value, to a cooked food which will take away that value. Ask yourself, what is it that I want to accomplish? If you decide to use the Super Food - Greens Plus you will begin to see how great you feel, aches & pains begin to diminish (a little). Cooked food takes away ALL NUTRIENTS which the body needs. Read up on the ingredients and decide. Hope this was helpful and let me know how it works out for you. Oh by the way, I am not a doctor nor am I a nutrionist.

Although dietary supplement regulations require that we list psyllium fiber as part of the carbohydrate total, it is, in fact, very different from carbohydrates such as sugar, glucose, fruit sugar, corn syrups, and starches.

I noticed that the DHA is higher in Cod Liver Oil...is this better or is the ratio the factor?", "answer": "When using the word \"better\" you need to define paramaters. A naturally harvested cod liver oil, Carlson for example, is tested for mercury content and many other very dangerous chemicals that have found their way into most fish. Cod liver oil is higher in vitamin D content, the lack of which has recently been associated with MS, and several other very bad afflictions. On the less severe list of afflictions is joint pain, a feeling of just feeling crappy, arthritis-like pains in the back, and so forth. One of the better medical websites maintained by an MD who has been associated with vitamins and minerals recommends 2000 IU's of vitamin D per day but unfortunately, all this vitamin crap you find on the big chain store shelves is synthetic - which means you system AT BEST is only absorbing ten percent of what you take of the synthetic crapola. The Carlson cod liver oil is produced in Norway and even though a teaspoon only contains 400 IUs of D, it is very pure so your system absorbs it all. Unfortunately, to preserve the cod liver oil's freshness, vitamin A is added, which means that every teaspoonful of codliver oil also has about twice as many IUs of vitamin A. Excess amount of vitamin A can be hazardous to your liver. So, we can say that the naturally harvested cod liver oil is \"better\" because it has no contaminants and is far more easily absorbed by your system, but the higher content of vitamin A it contains to preserve freshness is not so good, which makes it less better? I am afraid of fish oil because most contain a lot of mercury, and purity has always been in question."},

Of this, 500 mg. is DHA and 400 mg. is EPA. Many sources recommend 1 gram (1,000 mg) of EPA/DHA for maintenance, and this comes very close to what is contained in the 1 tsp. recommended dose. The air inside the bottle is replaced with nitrogen to keep it from becoming rancid before opening. They also add \"a natural source\" of Vitamin E to retard spoilage. Even though directions say to refrigerate after opening, I personally refrigerate it at all times. If you have a specific condition for which you want to take more than one gram of EPA/DHA, this this brand of Cod Liver Oil (which has 850 IU of Vitamin A) will not cause you to get too much Vitamin A.
