How you doing?
We're back We're gonna talk about your future
What do you want to become?
Well, um, I wanna be a physician's assistant 
OK What is a physician's assistant?
Well, normally when you go into a, into the doctor's office, you wouldn't usually get, well you would get your doctor all they do is check, give you check-ups or you know maybe take out stitches or something, not surgery You just go in and do the little things So the doctor does not have to do them
Oh, OK So that is what you want to do?
Yeah
OK 
And make lots of money
You wanna make lots of money
OK Nothing wrong with that 
How do you become a physici physician's assistant I can't even say it
It's a lot of schooling You have like six years, four or six years of college and you obviously take the,like nursing and other kinds of classes like that and then you do like um, two, two or four years at like a hospital as a
Like an assistant, or
Like, like you're actually doing
Oh, an intern 
An intern, yeah! An internship for two or four years at a hospital 
Then, that's it You finish
And then you hopefully go on and maybe have your own little doctor's place and open that up or something
Well, best wishes on becoming a physician's assistant I'm sure you'll make a good one 
Thank you 

What is your dream job?
My dream job is to become a diplomat representing my country, preferably in Japan That's why I came to Japan to learn Japanese and hopefully obtain a master degree in International Relations After getting my master's degree in International Relations, I would like to go home and enter the diplomat school for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is a three year program, and then, after that hopefully come back to Japan and work for the Norwegian Embassy in Tokyo 
Must be pretty competitive
It's very competitive, but I think if you know a certain language that not many people speak it gives you a competitive edge nevertheless so that's why I came to Japan because I know at this stage there are only 300 hundred people from Norway living in Japan and not all of them are here to study Japanese, they represent different companies or schools, or they're missionaries so, that's the track I'm on right now but we'll see how it goes in the end
How about when you were a child, what was your dream job? Did you want to be a diplomat when you were say, 10?
No, when I was ten I probably didn't know what I wanted to do I was just too busy playing in the street, you know, having fun with my friends and these things When I was that young I really didn't have a dream job like fireman, police I never really went through that stage, you know
I wanted to be a baseball player

Hi, what is so special about Hawaii? 
Well, Hawaii is my home, but to people not from Hawaii, I think Hawaii is famous for its nice weather, its warm all year âround, also itâs known for its beaches. The beaches are very nice. And itâs also known for its warm hospitality. The people are also very nice. 
So can you tell me more about the weather? Itâs always sunny? It never rains?
It does rain, but often it rains and it's sunny at the same time, so we have a lot of rainbows. Hawaii is also famous for rainbows. 
Thatâs nice. Can you tell me more about the beach? 
We have beaches on all shores of the island -- all our islands. Thereâs many beaches to choose from. And often, some beaches have big waves, some beaches have small waves, and you can choose which beach to go to depending on whether you want to surf in big waves or you want to swim where thereâs no waves.
Can you tell me maybe about the nature in Hawaii?
We have forests, so thereâs lots of animals, like birds, and small animals like wallabies we have Hawaiian wallabies and they live in the forest. 
Whatâs a wallaby?
Wallabies, theyâre those little mammals from Australia and they were introduced in Hawaii and now theyâre wild in Hawaii. Theyâve become their own species. 
What do they look like? 
They look like little kangaroos I think. 
Interesting. Any other interesting animals in Hawaii?
We have a lot of pigs, wild pigs. We like to go hunting for them and we like to eat them. 
Are there any animals that live in the sea? 
We have nice coral reefs, so thereâs lots of beautiful fish in our coral reefs and many people like to go snorkeling to look at our reefs. We also have turtles and seals in Hawaii. 
Are there any whales? 
We do have whales during the months of March till February I believe. They come from Alaska and they come to Hawaii during those months and then they return to Alaska.  Wow, there are a lot of animals that live in Hawaii. Sounds like a great place to visit. 
warm hospitality
Hawaii is also known for its warm hospitality.
Hospitality is being friendly to visitors by doing things like entertaining them and giving them food. In this case, warm does not refer to temperature, but to friendly people and atmosphere. If someone is very caring and nice, they are called warm. Look at the examples below
introduced
Wallabies were introduced from Australia and now they are wild in Hawaii. 
To bring a plant or animal to a new place and give it a chance to reproduce and establish itself in the new environment. Notice the two examples below
snorkeling
Many people like to go snorkeling to look at our reefs. 
Snorkeling is swimming with a mask and breathing through a short, curved tube. Snorkelers also usually use flippers on their feet to help them swim easier. See the following examples
till
We have whales from March till February.
Till is simply a short way to say until. In written form usually the full word until is used and till is mostly used in spoken language. It is sometimes also spelled âtil. See the examples below
sounds like
Sounds like a great place to visit.  Sounds like... means from what you are saying...
